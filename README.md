# self-assembling-manifold
The Self-Assembling-Manifold (SAM) algorithm.

# Installation:
SAM runs using python3.6 and has not yet been tested for backwards compatibility. Python can be installed using Anaconda.

Download Anacodna from here:
    https://www.anaconda.com/download/

Create and activate a new environment with python3.6 as follows:
```
conda create -n environment_name python=3.6
conda activate environment_name
```

Having activated the environment, SAM can be downloaded from the PyPI repository using pip or, for the development version, downloaded from the github directly.

PIP install:
```
pip install sam-algorithm
```

Development version install:
```
git clone https://github.com/atarashansky/self-assembling-manifold.git
cd self-assembling-manifold
python setup.py install
```

# Usage:
Please see the Jupyter notebook in the 'tutorial' folder for a basic tutorial. If you installed a fresh environment, do not forget to install jupyter into that environment! Please run
```
pip install jupyter
```
in your conda environment.
